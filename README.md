# Password Generator

This assignment was to use JavaScript to create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. 

# About
I was able to create this application with just one function. 

- When the "generate" button is clicked, the user is prompted to choose a password length between 8 and 128 characters. This criterion must be met.
- Then, the user must confirm whether they would like lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters. They must select at least one.
- The generated password appears on screen
